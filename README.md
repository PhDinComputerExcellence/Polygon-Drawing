# Polygon-Drawing

  This program uses coordinates from a "coordinates.txt" file and creates lines/cicles/ellipses using said coordinates. Coordinates must be
  identified using a a symbol at the start of the line. l for line, c for circle and e for ellipse. It creates the shapes using their own 
  algorithms.
